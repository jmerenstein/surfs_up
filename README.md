# An Analysis of Surfs Up

## Overview of Project
The overall goal of the project was to find out if the surf and ice cream shop in Oahu would be sustainable throughout the entire year. To analyze if it would be sustaiable or not I ran queries on the temperature data in Oahu for the months of June and December. The goal of the queries were to see the statisics on the temperatures for typically one of the hottest months of the year, June, and typically one of the coldest months, December. By looking at the temperature here I can see if it is both hot enough for people to want to surf as well as want ice cream throughout the whole year. 

## Results
- The first main difference between the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu are the mean of June temperature is just under 4 degrees hotter than the mean temperature in December. The mean of June temperatures is 74.94 degrees and the mean of December temperatures is 71.04 degrees. 
- The second main difference between the June and December temperature data is that the maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees and in December it is 83 degrees.
- The third main difference is that the minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees and in December it is 56 degrees. 
 - The summary statistics can be seen for June and the end of Deliverable 1 and for December and at the end of Delieverable 2 in the code [here](https://github.com/jmerenstein/surfs_up/blob/main/SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb). 


## Summary
- The analysis on the temperature data here clearly shows that the Surf's Up business would be viable all year round. By looking at what is typically one of the warmest months, June, and one of the coldest months, December, we can see how the temperature typically will change in Oahu throughout the year. What this analyis shows is that it is very warm in Oahu all year around with the temperatures shifting very little. This means that it is always a good time to surf and eat ice cream in Oahu and so that type of business should thrive there due to the great weather all year. 
- One more query that could be ran, is looking at the precipitation data for the months of June and Dcemeber. Buy looking at this data we can see if it rains a lot in either of these. If it did rain a lot in either month that could prevent people from wanting both ice cream and to to go surfing. 
- The last query I would run is to check how many stations are collecting the temperature and precipitatuon data for the months on June and December. It would be important to see that enough data was collected from all of these stations so that the data is reliable and could be trusted.
